BAISC SINGLE COMMAND

    	some example of basic commands without pipeline and I/O REDIRECION:

    	 
    	?   ls -l -a
    	?  mv file1 file2
    	?  cp file1 file2
    	?  rm file1 file2 .....
    	? grep  string filename 
    	 .
    	 .
    	 .


I/O REDIRECTIONS

		nsh supports input output redirection along with the append mode.

		> : output redirection
		< : input redirection
		>> : append to a file

		some example :
		?  cat < infile
		?  cat infile 
		? echo today's day is > newfile
		? date >> newfile


PIPES
		nsh also supports inter process communication using pipeline.  Output of 1 command can serve as the input for another command. nsh supports multiple pipeline also.
		Commands listed in the following are some examples of what nsh supports:


		?   who | fgrep -i .edu > foo
		? ls -l | sort -k 5nr
		? ls -l | grep somestring | wc -l > outfile
		.
		.
		..


CD

	  example:
	  ? mkdir temp
	  ? cd temp
	  ? cd ..

Bug in nsh:
	  
	   nsh has a small bug
	   >> operator does not append when there is only one command, but works fine on multiple pipe
